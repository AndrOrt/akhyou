# README #

There's an apprelease.apk in the files. Just download and have a go.

### What is this repository for? ###

Akhyou! is an app in its infancy that lets you stream anime to your Android using players of your choice. Currently it scrapes data from [animerush.tv](animerush.tv) and supports *DailyMotion* *MP4Upload* and *YourUpload* with plans to include more anime sites and more hosts in the future.  
There are no plans to release Akhyou! on Google Play at any stage in the future.

### How do I get set up? ###

- Currently everything's done almost solely in the MainActivity.class but there are plans to refactor to a proper, more easily maintainable architecture in the future.

**Dependencies:**  
- Jsoup  
- Okhttp + Picasso  

IDK what tests are lol.
