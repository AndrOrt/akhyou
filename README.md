Akhyou! is a material design android app in beta that scrapes streaming sites to provide users with an ad-free *intuitive* method of streaming and downloading the anime of their choice to the media player of their choice. Currently it scrapes two anime streaming sites but is built to be expandable. Upcoming features include *scrobbling* to [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net/) / [Hummingbird.me](https://hummingbird.me/), enhanced browsing (new releases, genres, etc.) and a *proper* anime details screen.
[Download](https://github.com/dulleh/akhyou/blob/master/akhyou-latest.apk?raw=true) and feel free to create an issue or send me an email with feedback. You also need to have a media player - the default one works but something like [MXPlayer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mxtech.videoplayer.ad&hl=en_GB) is a lot nicer! Trying to open the apk from the default "Downloads" app may also fail so it's worth trying install it with a dedicated file manager. You'll also need to [allow app installs from outside sources](http://www.androidcentral.com/allow-app-installs-unknown-sources) before you can install the app.  Enjoy~

There are no plans to release Akhyou! on the Play store in the future.
